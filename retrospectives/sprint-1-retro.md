Identify successes, positive team dynamics, and effective tools or processes to CONTINUE doing.
- Using AI tools for UI and itinerary design saved a lot of time.

What Didn't Go Well?
Pinpoint challenges, inefficiencies, or roadblocks to STOP doing, focusing on areas for improvement.
- Merge conflicts occurred when multiple members worked on the same frontend files.

What Could We Improve?
Brainstorm new strategies, tools, or process adjustments to START implementing in the next sprint.
- Break down user stories into smaller technical sub-tasks for frontend, backend, and AI modules.
- Always git pull before starting a new feature branch.
- Implement PR reviews to ensure architectural consistency (React + Node.js + PostgreSQL).
- Schedule regular syncs between the AI/ML and backend sub-teams for the recommendation engine.
